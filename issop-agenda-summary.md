# ISSOP Agenda summary

### Ongoing Projects and Initiatives

* ISSOP website updates - new domain, design, email, and Teams
* Potential participation in iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition
* Protocols for human omics samples collection/preservation/processing
* JAXA Digital Twins study in planning phase

### Standardization and Collaboration

* Developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for processing and sequencing biological samples from spaceflight missions
* Increasing communication and collaboration between space biology researchers
* Aligning ISSOP efforts with initiatives like NASA's GeneLab and UNOOSA's "Access to Space for All" program
* Providing opportunities for young researchers to get involved in space biosciences

### Policy and Regulatory Discussions

* Discussions on data management policies, data sharing, and privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR) impacting space research
* Exploring concepts for international regulatory harmonization and clarity

### Working Groups and Focus Areas

* ISSOP focus groups on topics like mouse control, MinION pipeline, hardware, sample processing, multi-omics, etc.
* Developing standardized terminology and metadata for mouse dissection/return and plant experiments
* Discussions on microbiome, virome, and yeast research in space
