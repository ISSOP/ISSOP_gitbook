# Data Management Plan Guide

## Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP) Overview

### Data Management

Describes the approach for managing data to ensure it is openly available, adhering to SMD policies. General guidance on the components of data management plans for SMD is provided in the [Data Management and Sharing](https://github.com/nasa/smd-open-science-guidelines/blob/main/OSS\_Guidance/Data\_Management\_Sharing.md) section.

### Software Management

Details the process for managing software developments, including how software will be shared openly, in compliance with SMD guidelines. General guidance on the components of software management plans for SMD is provided in the [Software Management and Sharing](https://github.com/nasa/smd-open-science-guidelines/blob/main/OSS\_Guidance/Software\_Management\_Sharing.md) section.

### Publication Sharing

Outlines the strategy for sharing publications derived from the project, ensuring open access in line with SMD requirements. The plan should also outline the methods expected to be used to make the publications publicly accessible, which will likely include options listed in [How to Share Publications](https://github.com/nasa/smd-open-science-guidelines/blob/main/OSS\_Guidance/Publications.md#how-to-share-publications).

The plan may also cover additional types of scientific information to be openly shared and further open science activities related to the project.

Many SMD funding opportunities starting with ROSES-2023 require an OSDMP instead of the previous requirement for a data management plan. The [ROSES Open Science and Data Management Plan page](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/OSDMP/) provides additional guidance for proposers.

OSDMPs should reflect the practices of specific research communities, and SMD divisions and/or specific ROSES program elements may provide additional guidance on components such as data management plans and software management plans.

### Preparing the OSDMP for Dual-Anonymous Peer Review

SMD uses a [dual-anonymous peer review](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/dual-anonymous-peer-review) (DAPR) process for the evaluation of many ROSES program elements. The OSDMP is included in the anonymized portion of the proposal for program elements using DAPR. Proposers to these program elements must write the OSDMP in an anonymized format that does not explicitly identify the names of the team members or their institutions. The [SMD DAPR page](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/dual-anonymous-peer-review) includes guidance for writing anonymized proposals and examples of anonymized proposal text.
