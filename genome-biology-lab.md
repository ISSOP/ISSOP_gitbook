# Genome Biology Lab

### About the lab



JAXA has collected more than 600 biology datasets related to the molecular changes that mice experience in space conditions. Mice contain numerous human orthologs and are suitable models to proximate physiological changes observed in humans. These rare and invaluable datasets include both actual and simulated spaceflight experiments that have investigated numerous body tissues (plasma, kidney, heart, spleen, leg muscles, etc.) across multiple sequencing types (RNA-seq, small RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq).

Tissue samples from all studies have been maintained in a database in the [Genome Biology Lab](http://www.md.tsukuba.ac.jp/basic-med/genome/index\_en.html) at the [University of Tsukuba](http://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/). The lab uses fresh-frozen techniques and then makes sections to harvest RNA. This is because some principal investigators want to use histology and immunohistochemistry techniques, and tissue structure is not well-preserved with RNAlater. The lab is also developing cell-free DNA techniques to conduct astronaut liquid biopsy studies in the near future.

### RNA-sequencing protocol
