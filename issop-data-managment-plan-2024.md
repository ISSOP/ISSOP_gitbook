# ISSOP data managment plan 2024

Data Management

The ISSOP consortium is committed to the open sharing of scientific data and metadata generated through its funded activities. All data produced will be made publicly available through established repositories and databases, adhering to the SMD policies outlined in SPD-41a.

Key elements of the ISSOP data management plan include:

1. Data Collection and Processing:
   * Standardized protocols will be developed and implemented for the collection, processing, and annotation of biological samples from spaceflight experiments.
   * Metadata describing experimental conditions, sample handling, and data generation will be captured using controlled vocabularies to enable interoperability.
   * Data quality control measures will be put in place to ensure consistency and reliability across ISSOP-funded projects.
2. Data Archiving and Preservation:
   * All raw and processed data will be deposited in appropriate public repositories such as NASA's GeneLab and the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive.
   * Data will be preserved in non-proprietary formats to ensure long-term accessibility and reusability.
   * Versioning and change tracking will be implemented to maintain the provenance of the data.
3. Data Sharing and Access:
   * ISSOP will promote the timely release of data, with a target of making data publicly available within 6 months of collection.
   * Data will be shared under permissive licenses (e.g., Creative Commons) to encourage broad reuse.
   * A centralized data portal will be developed to facilitate discovery and access to ISSOP-funded datasets.

Software Management

ISSOP-funded software developments will be managed and shared openly to enable reproducibility and further advancements in the field of space biology. The key elements of the software management plan include:

1. Software Development and Documentation:
   * All software developed through ISSOP funding will be documented with clear instructions for installation, usage, and modification.
   * Version control and issue tracking systems will be used to manage the software development lifecycle.
2. Software Sharing and Licensing:
   * ISSOP-funded software will be released under open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to encourage community contributions and reuse.
   * Software will be deposited in public code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to facilitate access and collaboration.
3. Software Sustainability:
   * ISSOP will work to ensure the long-term maintenance and support of critical software tools developed through its funding.
   * Community engagement and training activities will be organized to promote the adoption and continued development of ISSOP-supported software.

Publication Sharing

ISSOP is committed to the open dissemination of research findings derived from its funded activities. The publication sharing plan includes the following elements:

1. Open Access Publishing:
   * ISSOP will encourage and support its funded researchers to publish in open access journals or repositories, in compliance with SMD's open access requirements.
   * ISSOP will explore opportunities to establish institutional or consortium-level open access publishing agreements.
2. Preprint Sharing:
   * ISSOP researchers will be encouraged to share preprints of their work on recognized preprint servers (e.g., bioRxiv, medRxiv) prior to formal publication.
3. Data Availability Statements:
   * All ISSOP-funded publications will include clear data availability statements, directing readers to the relevant public repositories where the underlying data can be accessed.
4. Outreach and Engagement:
   * ISSOP will organize workshops, symposia, and other events to facilitate the dissemination of research findings to the broader scientific community and the public.
   * ISSOP will leverage its website and social media channels to highlight and promote the open sharing of its funded research outputs.

By implementing this comprehensive Open Science and Data Management Plan, ISSOP aims to foster a culture of openness, transparency, and collaboration within the space biology research community, ultimately accelerating scientific progress and discoveries.
